<h2> FFmpeg Website </h2>
<br>
The FFmpeg-Web Project is an innovative web application that seamlessly integrates the powerful capabilities of FFmpeg with modern web technologies such as HTML,
JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases a unique and interactive user experience, where a background video dynamically plays as the user scrolls through the webpage.
The scroll-triggered animation is carefully orchestrated using FFmpeg to manage video frames, ensuring a smooth and responsive visual experience.

As users navigate through the page, ongoing text overlays appear on the video, providing contextual information that aligns with the visual content being displayed.
These text overlays are designed to enhance the narrative of the video, offering insights and commentary that guide the viewer's understanding of the content.
The combination of FFmpeg's video processing power with the flexible and responsive design elements provided by Tailwind CSS and JavaScript results in a sophisticated and engaging
web experience that is both visually appealing and functionally robust. This project exemplifies the creative potential of integrating multimedia with web development to create immersive,
context-rich digital experiences.
